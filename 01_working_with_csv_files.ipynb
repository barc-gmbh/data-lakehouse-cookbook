    "## Step 1 - Working with CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What We're Going to Do\n",
    "In this first example, we’ll show you how to read a CSV file and perform basic analysis on it. The CSV file we’re using, `car_sales.csv`, contains over 500k records of US car sales data. Our goal is to find out **how many black BMWs were sold in 2015**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Getting Up and Running: Prerequisites \n",
    "Before we begin, you need to have [Python installed on your computer](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, you'll need a Python code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). If you don’t have these yet, ask your IT department for assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re serious about data processing and analysis with Python (and you should be!), I recommend investing in the best Python IDE available: [PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). For professional use, it’s worth every penny.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Installing Additional Python Libraries \n",
    "To load our CSV file and conduct analysis, we’ll need to install some additional libraries that enhance Python’s basic capabilities. One essential library is `pandas`, **the gold standard for data manipulation and analysis in Python**. Before using any library, you must first install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to do this is to open a console or terminal and type `pip install pandas`. If you are using Jupyter Notebook, you can run the installation command directly in a cell by typing `!pip install pandas`. This document is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We need to install the following four packages, all of which are free, open source, and widely used in the data analysis and data science community:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **pyArrow**: A lightning fast library for in-memoty data tables -> `pip install pyarrow`\n",
    "* **Pandas**: A powerful table-based data manipulation library. Tables are called 'DataFrames' -> `pip install pandas` \n",
    "* **DuckDB**: A free, kick-a** in-memory analytical database with SQL support -> `pip install duckdb`\n",
    "* **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for Python and NumPy -> `pip install matplotlib`"

    "To load our `car_sales.csv` CSV file, we need to import the `pandas` library and use the `read_csv(...)` function to load the data. We then use the `head()` function to show the first 5 rows of the dataset. The `tail()` function would show the last 5 rows, if you put a number in the brackets, you can show more or less rows. Try it - change the number, click \"run cell\" or press **<Ctrl+Enter>** and see what happens."
